# AWS EC2 Instances with Terraform and Remote Backend

This Terraform configuration deploys two EC2 instances in the AWS **eu-west-1** region. The state file is stored remotely in an S3 bucket for collaboration and version control.

## Prerequisites

Before using this configuration, ensure you have the following:

1. **Terraform** installed. [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
2. An AWS account and AWS credentials configured. [Set up AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
3. An S3 bucket created for storing the Terraform state file:
   - Bucket Name: (Modify the bucket name in the Terraform configuration file as needed).

## Configuration Details

### Provider
- **Region**: `eu-west-1`

### Backend
- **Type**: S3
- **Bucket Name**: (Modify `bucket` in the configuration with your S3 bucket name)
- **Key**: `terraform.tfstate`
- **Region**: `eu-west-1`

### EC2 Instances
1. **devec2**:
   - AMI: (Modify `ami` in the configuration to the desired AMI ID)
   - Type: `t2.medium`

2. **testec2**:
   - AMI: (Modify `ami` in the configuration to the desired AMI ID)
   - Type: `t2.medium`

### Modify Configuration
Update the Terraform configuration as follows:

1. Replace `ami` IDs with your preferred AMI for the `devec2` and `testec2` resources:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "devec2" {
       ami = "your-ami-id" # Replace with the desired AMI ID
       instance_type = "t2.medium"
   }
   ```

2. Replace `bucket` in the backend configuration with your S3 bucket name:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket = "your-s3-bucket-name" # Replace with your bucket name
       key    = "terraform.tfstate"
       region = "eu-west-1"
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skmahe1077/hashicorp-terraform-training-code.git
   cd Create_ec2_instance_with_backend
   ```

2. **Modify the configuration**:
   - Update the `ami` and `bucket` values in `main.tf` as needed.

3. **Initialize Terraform with Backend Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   This command will configure Terraform to use the S3 backend for state file storage.

4. **Plan the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Verify resources**:
   After deployment, verify the instances in the AWS Management Console.

## Additional Notes

1. **S3 Bucket**:
   Ensure that the specified S3 bucket exists in the `eu-west-1` region before running the configuration.

2. **AMI ID**:
   Use the AWS Console or CLI to identify the appropriate AMI for your region and requirements. Replace the AMI IDs in the configuration accordingly.

3. **Destroy Resources**:
   To destroy the infrastructure when no longer needed:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
